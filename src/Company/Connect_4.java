/**
Your task is to write an implementation of the game Connect-4 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

In Connect-4, there are two players, and each of the players take turns trying to get four of their game 
pieces in a row.
Write a functional subset of the code for the game board, game pieces, and player state. Your code should 
include functions to place a piece into the game board and check if one of the players has won the game. 
Your code should simulate the turns taken by players (in other words, you do NOT have to collect actual 
input from players, so you should not build UI to do so).

Your code should also include a function to print out the board, in ASCII. For example, here is a plausible
 print out after two turns - one from player 'x' and player 'o':
* * * * * * *
* * * * * * *
* * * * * * *
* * * * * * *
* x O * * * *
IMPORTANT: Give careful thought to your code organization and low-level algorithms. You can use the language 
of your choice to complete the question, but the code must be functional and given to us in a state where we 
can easily run it. If you choose to implement a solution in JavaScript, feel free to output to the browser's 
JavaScript console.
