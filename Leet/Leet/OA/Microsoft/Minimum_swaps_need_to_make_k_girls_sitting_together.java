/**
Given a string contains only "B"s and "G"s indicated a sequence of students, 
while "B" means a boy and "G" means a girl. Write a function called minSwaps(students, k) 
to calculate the minimum swaps need to make k girls sitting together. 
Note that you could only swap two students if they are adjacent.

Example 1:

Input: students = "BGGBBG", k = 3
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: students = "BGGBGBGBBGGG", k = 4
Output: 2
